# Comments-purifier
This project was made for replacing mean comments in the cyber space to nicer words by AI technology.

## What the project does

Combining a program that detects mean comments and a program that purifies the meaning contained within, this program automatically detects and cleans malicious comments.

## Why the project is useful

There are countless eye-watering mean, critical comments.
What's a way to stop such malicious comments?
Preventing an account that receives a report on malicious comments from writing comments can be a simple solution.
However, it is hard to agree that it is the right way to take away someone's freedom of expression to prevent the problem of malicious comments.
So, I came up with a peaceful way.

## Target User

Any developer who creates a bulletin board with comments feature
